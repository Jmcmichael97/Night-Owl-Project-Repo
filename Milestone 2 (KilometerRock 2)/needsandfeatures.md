NEEDS AND FEATURES

Our application will take input from the user about what they want to do
for a DND/TTRPG campaign. They will describe broad concepts of what they 
want the campaign to be like, quests, maps, encounters, and NPCs. The
application will then return AI generated content for the user to put in
their campaign. This will include images for maps and characters and
descriptions of quests, encounters, characters, and likely more. The user
can create an account to store these assets and download them to their
device. This will give users the ability to create a campaign without
needing to spend as much time as the planning often requires.

To do this, we will first need to be able to use the OpenAI API. We will
need to make requests using the user's input and then display the response.

We will then need to give the user the ability to create an account, save
their assets, and download them.

Another primary objective would be editing. The extent of editing would 
vary depending on the type of resource. Quest descriptions might only
be a plain text file, so we could provide a way to edit the text, but
that would be the only option. For maps, there are many more possible
editing options. The most obvious is the ability to apply and remove a
grid.

Another feature would be the ability to delete resources. Users would
need to be able to remove resources from their account.
