# Spider-Man Multiverse Project Idea

Since the upcoming "Spider-Man: Across the Multiverse" movie is coming soon, I had an idea for a web application to learn about
the different variations of Spider-Man.

## The Details

My idea was that "Spider-Man Multiverse" could be a website where users can learn about the different variations of Spider-Man across various comic book universes, movies and TV shows.

The site would also have an API that could be used to retrieve information on specific Spider-Man versions and would allow users to explore the different abilities and powers of each version.

The features of this website:
1. The main page would show a list of countless Spider-Man Variations, where users can click on an item and will bring up a dedicated page about that specific Spider-Man.
2. The website would also feature a section for a detailed timeline of all the different Spider-Man variations.
3. The website could also add something fun like an interactive quiz that helps users find out which version of Spider-Man they are most like.
