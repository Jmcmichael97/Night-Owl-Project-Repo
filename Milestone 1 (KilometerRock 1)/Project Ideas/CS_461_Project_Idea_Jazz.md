CS 461 Project Idea:

Spotify API:
A web app that guesses your MBTI Personality Type based off of the music you listen to off of Spotify
and recommends music based off of it.

This is just a fun little quiz thing that guesses what your Myers Briggs Type Indicator is. It scans through your listening history, playlists, liked songs, genres listened to, etc. to categorize you to the MBTI you may be perceived to be. In addition to this, it will even recommend you music that fits the genre mostly played and/or music that is perceived to be of that MBTI type.

ChatGPT's Advice on how to start it:
1. First, you will need to create the basic structure of your web application using a framework such as Express.js or Flask. This will include setting up routes for different pages, as well as creating a basic HTML template for your application.

2. Next, you will need to set up a way to authenticate with the Spotify API. This will likely involve creating a client ID and secret, and then using them to request an access token for the user.

3. Once you have access to the Spotify API, you can begin to retrieve data for the user, such as their playlists and listening history. This data can be used to make recommendations for music.

4. In order to determine the user's personality type, you will need to create a way for them to take the MBTI test. This could be done using a series of HTML forms and JavaScript, or by using an existing library or API.

5. Once you have the user's personality type, you can use this information to make music recommendations. This could be done by matching the personality type to a specific genre or artist, or by using a more complex algorithm that takes into account the user's listening history and other factors.

6. Finally, you will need to display the music recommendations to the user. This could be done using a simple HTML list, or by integrating with a music player such as Spotify's Web Playback SDK.
